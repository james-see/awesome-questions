Questions for new employees
===========================

1. How do you want to be rewarded?

Some people like being rewarded with $$$, coffee, endless snacks, etc.

"if you give them a chance to spell it out for you, you’ll have a crystal clear vision of how you can motivate them. Whether you change up your reward system to incorporate additional days off, midweek dress-down days, weekly team recognition meetings, or a structured bonus program, when you include the things they actually want, they’ll likely be a lot more willing to put in that extra effort."

2. How do you work best?

Music, sitting on floor, standing, etc.

"Maybe you let them work from home one day a week, stash some snacks in a central area, allow them to take a short break every hour, or let them lounge on the floor with their laptops instead of sitting at a desk. As long as the request is reasonable and within your authority, you can help create a comfortable work environment that will help them produce their best work."

3. What can I do to make your job easier?
